Roster import instructions
-------------------------
1. Provide one agent per row with the following columns:
   • Agent Name – the full display name (case-insensitive match). Unknown names are added to the roster automatically.
   • Date – use YYYY-MM-DD or any Excel date value that resolves to the calendar day. Reduce to the seven consecutive days you intend to publish.
   • Shift – use one of the supported shift labels (6AM-3PM, 1PM-10PM, 2PM-11PM, 10PM-7AM, 12PM-9PM) or a leave code (WO, ML, PL, EL, UL, CO, MID-LEAVE). Any other columns are ignored during importing.
2. Each row is interpreted as a single agent on a single day. The importer automatically places the row on the correct shift column, creates missing shifts, and positions leave types under the leaves/WO section.
3. After a successful import, the calendar picker jumps to the earliest date in the file so you can review that week; you can still navigate to any other day manually.
4. Leave the file in CSV, XLSX, or XLS format and upload it from the roster header button labeled “Import Weekly Roster”.
5. Missing shifts are filled with the same styling as the rest of the grid, so you only need to include the shift label that actually applies.
